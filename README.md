# Oddit

Oddit stands for "Odd IT Jobs"

Here's a screenshot of our first alpha version:

### Tell me more...
We started this project out of a need for small jobs we could do.  Take an Electrician for example, they can come around and put in a new light switch for you, you pay them $80 and they go away. Job well done. But why is such a thing uncommon in the Information Technology industry?

There's always someone who:

 - Needs the banner on their Wordpress website replaced
 - Needs their email newsletter system updated
 - Requires maintenance on their PHP website
 - Wants an email system for their business domain
 - Wants a mobile app for their business prototyped
 - Fixing their Shopify/Joomla/Drupal site
 - ... and so on

**However** where do the people/organisations get people for these jobs? They're either gambling on a student, or wasting money on a consultant. **Oddit** is the solution. A place to find people with the skills you need to do one-offs, casual and fixed-term jobs.

### The source code

Oddit is built on the Python Django framework. 

Packages required (install using pip):

 - MySQLdb 
 - anyjson 
 - openid.association
 - django-registrations

There's not really much to making this work, it's all very simple-like. If you do end up fiddling with this code
remember parts of it were created 3 to 4 years ago, so that was most likely Django 1.2 (and Django 2.0 is nearly out).

We'll be accepting pull requests and fixing issues/bugs posted. Help Oddit thrive!
